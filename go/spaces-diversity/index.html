        	<h2>To make visible the <acronym lang="en" title="Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual.">GLBT</acronym> reality in the names of the streets of our towns and cities</h2>
        	<p>The names of the public spaces (you remain silent, squares, walks, avenues, etc.) of towns and cities come determined by the history characteristic of each town and, partly, for which is common to the widest territory in which they are located. There are traditional names whose origin gets lost -and sometimes also its meaning- in the most remote past; others are more recent and more transparent, bound to the growth and the one it enlarges of the urban helmets. These last ones, in many cases, they usually have a double value: they designate a concrete part of a city or town and, at the same time, they refer to a reality that anything has to do with that urban tract to which they give name. When a municipal corporation should name a square of new creation in a neighborhood, if it chooses the name of a poet, for example, it is not only designating to the square in question, but paid homage to the poet whose name will take the square. With the result that many of the names of the urban ways have an unquestionable political and social value. In general, a hour to "baptize" the new urban spaces, names related with the values, the facts or people are looked for that are had for more outstanding by the social group. However, the diversity of the street ones of our towns and cities don't usually show never the <acronym lang="en" title="Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual.">GLBT</acronym> reality  that is wrongly relegated and silenced this way.</p>
        	<p><strong>Xente Gai Astur -<acronym lang="ast" title="Xente Gai Astur.">XEGA</acronym>-</strong>, with this web page, it seeks to contribute concrete proposals to break this silence whose origin is almost always based on the homophobia, one seals social that is necessary to eradicate. They are four the names that we propose in the following pages and, although other many could be chosen, we believe that they are of the most important that are related with the gay, lesbian, transsexual and bisexual reality. <strong><a href="magnus-hirschfeld.html" title="Magnus Hirschfeld and the Pink Triangles.">Magnus Hirschfeld</a></strong>, in spite of the difficulties that he can offer its name to the Castilian phonetics, is a pioneer character in the fight for the rights of the <acronym lang="en" title="Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual.">GLBT</acronym> collective; the <strong><a href="magnus-hirschfeld.html" title="Magnus Hirschfeld and the Pink Triangles.">Pink Triangle</a></strong> is the memory of a barbarism -the Nazi- that should never have more space in our society and it constitutes its memory a homage of solidarity with the deported that had to take them in its suits of prisoners; <strong><a href="stonewall.html" title="Stonewall and the June 28 of 1969.">Stonewall</a></strong> and the date of <strong><a href="stonewall.html" title="Stonewall and the June 28 of 1969.">June 28</a></strong> are the origin of a new time for lesbians, gay, transsexual and bisexual people, of hope and legal advances and of social normalization.</p>
        	<p>When anyone of these names can be designating a public space of anyone of our towns or cities, it will have been opened the way in the fight by the respect to the difference, in the attainment of the diversity and in the deep of the democratic values.</p>
